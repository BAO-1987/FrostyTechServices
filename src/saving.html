                    1. Regular Maintenance
                  </h3>

                  <p>
                    Keeping your air conditioning system in top condition is crucial for its efficiency. Regular
                    maintenance includes cleaning or replacing air filters every 30-60 days, checking the coolant
                    levels, and ensuring the coils and fans are clean and in good working order. A well-maintained unit
                    operates more efficiently, using less energy to cool your home.

                    2. Use a Programmable Thermostat
                  </h3>

                  <p>
                    A programmable thermostat can be a game-changer for controlling your cooling costs. By setting your
                    thermostat to adjust the temperature automatically at different times of the day (e.g., higher when
                    you're not home and cooler when you return), you can significantly reduce energy consumption.

                    3. Optimize Air Flow

                  <p>
                    Improving air flow can enhance your AC's efficiency. Ensure that furniture or curtains are not
                    blocking the air vents. Consider using ceiling fans along with your AC to circulate the air more
                    effectively; this can allow you to set the thermostat a few degrees higher without compromising on
                    comfort.

                  <p>
                    Sealing leaks around doors, windows, and air ducts can prevent cool air from escaping, reducing the
                    workload on your AC. Similarly, proper insulation in your home, especially in the attic, can help
                    maintain the desired temperature by keeping the hot air out and the cool air in.

                  <p>
                    If your air conditioning unit is old and inefficient, consider upgrading to a newer,
                    energy-efficient
                    model. Look for units with a high Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) rating. While the upfront
                    cost may be higher, the energy savings over time can be substantial.

                  <p>
                    Effective use of blinds, curtains, and shades can block out the sun's rays, significantly reducing
                    the heat entering your home. Thermal window treatments can be particularly effective in keeping your
                    home cooler without over-relying on the AC.

                  <p>
                    Try to avoid activities that generate a lot of heat, such as cooking on the stove or using the
                    dishwasher, during the hottest parts of the day. Instead, schedule these activities for the early
                    morning or late evening.

                    Take advantage of cooler temperatures in the early morning and late evening by opening windows to
