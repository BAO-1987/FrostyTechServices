                  1. Eco-Friendly Refrigerants
                </h3>

                <p>
                  Traditional air conditioning systems have relied on refrigerants that, while effective in cooling,
                  pose significant environmental risks due to their high global warming potential (GWP). The latest
                  innovations in air conditioning technology have seen the development of eco-friendly refrigerants
                  with lower GWP, reducing the carbon footprint of cooling systems. These new refrigerants, such as
                  R-32 and HFO-1234yf, offer a sustainable alternative without compromising on efficiency.

                <p>
                  Harnessing solar energy to power air conditioning systems represents a significant leap towards
                  sustainable cooling. Solar-powered air conditioners use photovoltaic panels to convert sunlight into
                  electricity, powering the unit without drawing from the grid. This innovation not only cuts down on
                  energy consumption but also offers a greener alternative by utilizing renewable energy sources.

                  4. Thermal Energy Storage
                </h3>

                <p>
                  Thermal energy storage is an innovative approach that involves storing cold energy during off-peak
                  hours (usually at night) and using it to cool spaces during peak demand times. This technology helps
                  in balancing the load on the electrical grid and allows for more efficient use of energy resources.
                  By shifting the energy demand, thermal energy storage can lead to substantial savings on energy
                  costs and contribute to the overall stability of the power grid.
