            Selecting the right size air conditioner for your home is crucial for ensuring comfortable temperatures,
            efficient energy use, and prolonging the life of your AC unit. An oversized air conditioner can lead to
            short cycling, where the unit turns on and off frequently, wasting energy and placing unnecessary stress
            on the compressor.
