            comfortable. However, to ensure that AC unit operates efficiently
            and lasts for years to come, regular maintenance is key. In this

                <h2>Keep the Air <br> Filters Clean</h2>

                <p>
                  One of the simplest yet most crucial maintenance tasks for
                  your air conditioner is regularly cleaning or replacing the
                  air filters. Dirty filters restrict airflow, forcing your AC
                  system to work harder and consuming more energy. Aim to
                  clean or replace your filters every 1-2 months during the
                  cooling season

                <p>
                  Check the area around your outdoor AC unit regularly and
                  remove any debris, such as leaves, branches, or grass
                  clippings. A cluttered outdoor unit obstructs airflow and
                  can lead to reduced efficiency and performance.
                  Additionally, ensure there's at least two feet of clearance
                  around the unit to allow for proper airflow

                  While there are tasks you can perform yourself, such as
                  changing filters and clearing debris, it's also essential to
                  schedule annual professional maintenance for your air
                  conditioner. A certified HVAC technician can inspect your
                  system, identify potential issues, and perform necessary
                  repairs or adjustments to keep it running smoothly
